## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. The primary goal is to solidify my understanding of fundamental concepts and prepare for coding interviews.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `arrays/`: Solutions related to array problems.
- `linked-lists/`: Solutions for linked list problems.
- `stacks-queues/`: Implementations of stack and queue problems.
- `trees/`: Solutions for binary trees, binary search trees, and other tree structures.
- `graphs/`: Solutions related to graph algorithms.
- `sorting-searching/`: Implementation of various sorting and searching algorithms.
- `miscellaneous/`: Solutions for miscellaneous problems not categorized above.

Each directory contains:
- `problem_name.java`: The Java implementation of the problem.
- `README.md`: A brief description of the problem and approach.
